    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work" target="_blank" title="CSS specification">Cascading Style
        Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
        in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a
        cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<img src = "coding2.jpg" width = "100%"></p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
        separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file
        to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
